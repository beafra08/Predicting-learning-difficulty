# Predicting-learning-difficulty
The project was developed using data available at the following web site : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uppulurimadhuri/dataset
This dataset includes 1985 patients with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with information on 28 variables 

The code in R language is available on this github page 

The goal was to create a predictive model using the data to predict the presence of learning disorder in this population
We wanted to use simple demographic variables that any family member knows (age, sexe, ethnicity, presence of ASD in the family) and combine with the results 
of a 10-question test called Autism Spectrum Quotien avilable online or at the general docrtor's office to detect learning disorder in the ASD population 

The general code of data treatment and the development of our best neuronal network is available in the codeR section 
The tryingmodels page will soon be updated with a complete code in R language of the 30 models tested during our study
